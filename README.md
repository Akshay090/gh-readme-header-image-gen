# GitHub Profile README Header Image Generator

*That's a very long name. By the time I finish reading the title, a whole day will be over.*

Generate header images for your GitHub profile READMEs.

GitHub now allows us to add READMEs to our profile describing ourselves but what if we need a header image in the README with your name and a small greeting? This generator comes to your rescue and saves the day (well, not a big thing and not very useful and it doesn't really save the day :shrug:)
